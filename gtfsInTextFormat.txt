2 Specify the files in israel-public-transportation
2.1 The files in the israel-public-transportation package are compatible with the
GTFS format.
2.2 It should be emphasized that in the GTFS format, there are files and fields
that are optional. Some have already been used and some have not been
used at this stage. The developer must consider the possibility that, over time,
fields or files that are optional will be added or removed from the israel-public-
transportation package.
2.3 The following is a list of the files transferred in the israel-public-transportation
package:
Filed name

Explanation
Operator ("‫)"מפעיל‬ code.
Operator Name.
URL of the operator site.
Fixed value: Asia / Jerusalem.
Fixed value: he (Hebrew).
2.5 Explanation of routes file
2.5.1
The file contains a row for each line identifier. The meaning of the term
"line ID" is the combination of: line-direction-alternative (“-‫כיוון‬-‫קו‬
‫)”חלופה‬, which creates unique identification of the line.
2.5.2
For example: line 86 is from Ariel to Petah Tikva and back. This line
has 6 different alternatives (“‫)”חלופות‬, each has a unique line identifier,
as illustrated by the following table:
Route_id
9141
9142
9143
9146
9147

2.5.4
For each such alternative, there are three parameters that are unique
to the alternative: schedule, sequence of stops, and trip route.
2.5.5
Even when one of these data changes (schedule / stations / route) the
record remains with the same route_id.
2.5.6
The fields in the file are shown in the following table (and also at
https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/#routestxt ):
Field name
route_id
agency_id
route_short_name
route_long_name
Explanation
A unique and permanent code for a line identifier, as
explained above.
Operator code, the field linking to the ‘agency’ file.
This field shows the signs of the line, which usually appear on
the sign on the bus itself, which is determined and maintained
only by the operator, for example, the line signs can be 86,
‫א‬86 etc.
For Israel Railways lines, the field is empty.
This field is composed of the following combining: name of
departure station + name of departure city + destination
station name + destination city name + direction + alternative.
Direction - meaning forth (1) or back (2).
For example, this field for line 86 from Ariel to Petah Tikva,
direction 1 alternative #, would look like this:
1#-‫תקווה‬ ‫פתח‬-‫שנקר‬/‫>ז'בוטינסקי‬-<‫אריאל‬-‫כדורגל‬ ‫מגרש‬
For Israel Railways lines, this field is composed of the
following combining: name of departure station + name of
departure city + destination station name + destination city
name. example:
‫עדה‬ ‫גבעת‬ ‫בנימינה‬-‫בנימינה‬>-<‫יפו‬ ‫אביב‬ ‫תל‬-‫ההגנה‬ ‫אביב‬ ‫תל‬
This field contains a chaining of the following 3 items:
• Line catalog number ('‫קו‬ ‫)'מק"ט‬.
• Line direction ('‫)'כיוון‬.
• Line alternative ('‫)'חלופה‬.
route_desc
The 'line catalog number' contains of 5 digits, and is unique
for the line, and does not change throughout the life of the
line, and constitutes a kind of "identity card" for the line.
For example - in line 86 of the Afikim operator, as explained
above, for all the alternatives of the line, there is the same
'line catalog number' 32086, and for direction 1 and
alternatives #, the field would look like:

2.6 Explanation of trips file
2.6.1
The file contains the single trip. This file is linked to ‘routes’,
’stop_times’ files.
2.6.2
The fields in the file are shown in the following table (see also
https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/#tripstxt ) :
Field name

Field name
trip_id
trip_headsign
direction_id
shape_id
Explanation
Running number (unique). Field links to ‘stop_times’ file.
For your attention:
1. For the same trip that repeats itself on each Sunday-
Thursday, this field is the same for the same time on all
days.
2. The dates on which the trip takes place should be taken
from ‘calendar’ file which lists the days of the line and its
date range.
3. It should be noted that the trip_id field in this file is a
running number only. The date field structure
(xxxx_ddmmyy) is meaningless to the user in the files, but
is intended to create a unique field only.
4. It should also be emphasized that this field does not
reflect the actual "trip ID" of the public transport operators
in Israel. The information for the "trip ID" - the exact day of
the week and hour of day, is detailed in the reference file
found in the package: ‘TripToDate’.
For the end stations of the line, besides the name of the
official station appearing in the signs, there is also a
destination station for publication, which is an intuitive
name for the passenger. For example, when a station
whose official name is "‫קניונשוק‬/‫"אגריפס‬, appears on the
line as the final destination of the line, the name of the
destination station for publication will be "‫יהודה‬ ‫מחנה‬ ‫"שוק‬.
In this field, where the locality of origin and destination are
the same - the value in this field will be the name of the
destination station for publication. In cases where the
locality of origin and destination locality of the line are
different, the name of the destination city will be added to
the name of the target station for publication, as well as
the name of the destination city_ (bottom line) and the
destination station name of the line.
For Israel Railways trips, this field contain train number.
The direction of trip can be 0 or 1, in this field we make the
following values:
0 = 1 or 3 (rounds) in MOT licensing system (forth)
1 = 2 on MOT licensing system (back)
Field linking to a ‘shapes’ file (this field can sometimes
remain blank).
For Israel Railways trips, this field is empty.

2.7 Explanation of calendar file
2.7.1
The file displays the line activity by date. When a value in a line
(station list or schedule) changes, the service_id changes to a new
record with the appropriate dates.
2.7.2
As long as the line behaves in the same way within the date range
there will be one row.
2.7.3
As soon as there is a change in the schedule of the line, a new row
will be added for a given day or date.
2.7.4
The fields in the file are shown in the following table (see also
https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/#calendartxt ) :

Start date of record activity The format is a requirement of
Google: Format: YYYYMMDD.
Meaning start_date is the start date of the record - if the
calendar date creation date starts in the middle of the record
date range, the date "is cut off" and starts on the same day as
the calendar file creation.
Example: If record dates are 10/1-15/1 and the file creation
date is 12/1 - the starting date will be 12/1.
Until the record activity date.

2.7.5
Example: Throughout the period, the line behaves in the same
manner (same schedule) for the days Sunday - Thursday and another
schedule for Friday, and is not active on Saturday so it has two lines.
(If there was another schedule for the line on Saturday there was
another row) If in the same date range there was an event in which
the schedule was different, rows were added accordingly.

2.11 Explanation of fare_rules
2.11.1 The files: fare_rules, fare_attributes allow you to locate the single ride
fare (“‫בודדת‬ ‫נסיעה‬ ‫מחיר‬”) from each source stop (“‫עליה‬ ‫)”תחנת‬ to each
destination station (“‫ירידה‬ ‫)”תחנה‬ of the active lines at the same time.
The fare_rules file includes only the codes within the date range of the
information in the GTFS files
2.11.2 The files contain the single ride fare of all public transport operators.
2.11.3 In case that route has a single fare: route_id will have a value, and
origin_id, destination_id will be empty.
2.11.4 In case that route has more than one fare: route_id will empty, and

3 Specify the files in ClusterToLine package
3.1 The package includes a single file named ClusterToLine that shows the
association of the line to the cluster (“‫)”אשכול‬.
3.2 Public transport lines are grouped in clusters according to geographic regions,
and/or according to MOT tenders.
3.3 The file contains the data available in the MOT licensing system, as of the
issue date. Therefore, in cases where a line passes from cluster to cluster, it
may appear for a certain time period twice, once to the outgoing cluster and
once to the new cluster.
3.4 The fields in the file are shown in the following table:
Field name

4 Specify the files in TripIdToDate package
4.1 The package includes a single file called `TripIdToDate` that allows to
associate a single `TripId` according to the day of the week of the trip.
4.2 There are 2 kinds of "trip id" in the static files:
4.2.1
`trip_id` – this field comply to GTFS reference an is used just to link
between `trips` and `stop_times` tables.
4.2.2
TripId – a unique number for each trip in a day, so each trip in a day
gets a different TripID value. The TripId is used for many systems to
identify a specific trip in a day.
4.3 Usually, the use a specific value of TripId can be repeated at same week day,
over weeks, but not in the same week. However, this is not mandatory, and
the developer should find `TripId` values according to the `TripIdToDate`
table.
4.4 The file is under "28 hours in a day", from 4:00 to 03:59 in the next day. For
example: a trip at 1:00 AM in the night between Sunday and Monday should
be treated as it is on Sunday, for matching with FromDate, ToDate,
DayInWeek fields.
4.5 Values after midnight are continued as 24:00 till 27:59, so, for example 1 AM
is 25:00.
4.6 Example: to find all TripID from Sunday 17/11/2024 at 04:00 till 18/11/2024 at
03:59, filter the `TripIdToDate` table with all the following conditions:
4.6.1DayInWeek == 1
4.6.217/11/2024 >= FromDate
4.6.317/11/2024 <= ToDate
4.7 To match between a `TripId` of a trip to a trip defined at `trips`, `calendar`,
`stops_times` use the following conditions:
4.7.1
TripIdToDate,DepartureTime == stop_time.departure_time be aware
that `trips`, `calendar`, `stops_times` are describing trips for a "day"
Update Date:
21/11/2024
Page 13 of 24National Authority for
Public Transport
GTFS - Developer Information
between midnights while `TripIdToDate` is for a "day" between 4:00
AM till 3:59 AM in the next day.
4.7.2
TripIdToDate.LineDetailRecordId == trips.route_id
4.8 There can be more than one `TripId` value for same day and
`LineDetailRecordId` and in these cases it means that more that one bus are
scheduled to depart for a certain route at a certain time.
4.9 The `TripId` filed links to `DatedVehicleJourney` at the SIRI-SM feed.
4.10 The file does not include `TripId` values for Israel Railways.
